# Plagiarism-Detector

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.
This Project is part of the Module 'Machine Learning, Case Studies' in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, offered at Udacity, School of AI.

# Project Overview
In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.

This project will be broken down into three main notebooks:

# Outline

## Notebook 1: Data Exploration

- Load in the corpus of plagiarism text data.

- Explore the existing data features and the data distribution.


## Notebook 2: Feature Engineering

- Clean and pre-process the text data.

- Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.

- Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.

- Create train/test .csv files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.


## Notebook 3: Train and Deploy Your Model in SageMaker

- Upload your train/test feature data to S3.

- Define a binary classification model and a training script.

- Train your model and deploy it using SageMaker.

- Evaluate your deployed classifier.

# Setup

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory of Udacity's repo for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
